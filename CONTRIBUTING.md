### Workflow

Some quick notes regarding getting your awesome work merged into the project:

+ Fork the project.
+ Clone down your fork ( git clone git@github.com:[username]/play-spark-module.git ).
+ Create or selected an issue to work on.
+ Create a topic branch to contain your change ( git checkout -b my_awesome_feature ).
+ Hack away, add tests. Not necessarily in that order.
+ Make sure everything still passes the builds
+ If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.
+ Push the branch up ( git push origin my_awesome_feature ).
+ Create a pull request, referring the issue(s), against play-spark-module and describe what your change does and the why you think it should be merged.


### Documentation

Please help us make documentation better. All documentation pull requests should be directed at *master*. Pull requests directed at another branch will not be accepted.
